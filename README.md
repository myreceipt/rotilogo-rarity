# Logo Pabrik Roti - Rarity

Logo Pabrik Roti - rarity score calculation base on the ERC721 smart contract and the NFT metadata.

This rarity score calculation forked by [@MyReceiipt](https://linktr.ee/myreceipt/) from Cool Rarity that made with love by [Fukuball](https://twitter.com/fukuball) in a [Hackathon](https://github.com/punkscape/01-rarity-analyser-hackathon) hosted by [PunkScape](https://punkscape.xyz/). It is easy to configure for developers and easy to use for users, any ERC721 NFT collection with [OpenSea metadata standard](https://docs.opensea.io/docs/metadata-standards) can use this as the rarity score calculation tool. If you have the collection metadata in hand, you can depoly it as your collection rarity tool in minues!
